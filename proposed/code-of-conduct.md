# Code of Conduct for the MODX Project

Note: This recommendation is a DRAFT for consideration of the MODX Advisory Board. 

A Code of Conduct is a document that details how individuals are expected to behave in a certain context. By providing a baseline for interactions, and a process for dealing with incidents, we can ensure everyone feels welcomed to the community. 

Editor: Mark Hamstra

First published draft: Not yet reviewed/published.

## Goal of Recommendation

The recommendation serves to ensure a welcoming environment in the online and offline MODX community. This is accomplished through two aspects of this recommendation:

- The Code of Conduct document, based on the Contributor Covenant, which contains the baseline for respect and inclusivity that we expect from everyone involved with the MODX community.
- A process definition and guidelines that explain how the MODX Advisory Board responds to reports of breaches of the Code of Conduct.  

## Relevant Recommendations

None.

## Recommendation

### 1. The Code of Conduct

The text for the proposed Code of Conduct can be found in Attachment 1. It is based on the [Contributor Covenant 1.4.0](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/), which is a widely used Code of Conduct and should be considered included verbatim in this recommendation. 

#### 1.1 Why MODX should have a Code of Conduct 

Compared to other CMS and Technical Communities, MODX has been fortunate enough to have a friendly community with to my knowledge no serious incidents when it comes to discrimination, unsolicited sexual language or advanced, or other behaviour that would be in violation of a Code of Conduct. 

However, that does not mean that incidents do not exist. By looking at the broader technical community it is evident that problems do exist, and it would be naive to claim MODX has not, or will not at some point, experience similar events. 

One example of how MODX may be affected, is the homogeneity of attendance at the MODXpos of the recent years. Statistics on the presence of underrepresented groups at events are not readily available, however an estimate 90%+ of attendants of the MODXpo 2012 (Utrecht, The Netherlands), MODXpo 2013 (Cologne, Germany), MODX Weekend 2014 (Zeist, The Netherlands), and the MODXpo 2015 (Munich, Germany); were straight caucasian males. This same phenomenon can also be seen in the speaker line ups for those events. It is highly unlikely that this percentage is representative of the broader MODX community, which might indicate a subconscious bias or underrepresented groups feeling unwelcome.

By adopting a Code of Conduct it is made clear to everyone involved in the Community how we are expected to treat each other. It also provides a framework for responding to incidents as they appear, which communicates to people who may have experienced mistreatment in the past that the MODX Project will have their back should an incident occur. This framework is described in section 2.

#### 1.2 Applicability of the Code of Conduct (Online)

There is no singular place the MODX Community convenes. There are online avenues such as the official MODX Forums, the issue and pull request trackers on the project repositories on GitHub, the Community Slack channel, social media, and more. There are also offline places where the MODX Community meets, such as during community organised MODX Meetups and MODXpos. 

The Code of Conduct is to apply to all officially represented online channels. This means that any online channel which is owned, managed, hosted, moderated or adopted by the MODX Project Leadership, MODX Advisory Board or MODX Ambassadors are expected to adhere to the Code of Conduct.

This includes the following:

- The official MODX Forums, currently hosted at forums.modx.com
- The “revolution” and “evolution” repositories hosted on GitHub.com, including the issues, pull requests, commit messages, wikis, and other communication that takes place there. 
- The MODX Community Slack team (accessible through modxcommunity.slack.com and modx.org) 
- Social Media channels managed or moderated by the Project Leadership or MODX Advisory Board, such as the LinkedIn MODX Group and official MODX Facebook page. 

#### 1.3 Applicability of the Code of Conduct (Offline)

The Code of Conduct is also to apply to offline channels, and in particular events that meet the following criteria:

- The event is organised, hosted or managed by the MODX Project Leadership, the MODX Advisory Board, or a MODX Ambassador, or if its name implies it is. For example a “MODXpo”, “MODX Day”, or “MODX Weekend” must use the Code of Conduct even if it is organised, hosted or managed by a third party. 
- The event carries a focus on MODX.

For offline events that meet the criteria, the organiser(s), host(s) or manager(s) of the event must ensure:

1. The code of conduct is easily accessible for (prospective) attendees.
2. Before and during the event attendees are prompted to the existence of the code of conduct.  
3. For events with over 50 attendees at least one person must be available as an on-site code of conduct liaison. This person must understand the Code of Conduct and the response guidelines, and be able of acting on them should an incident occur during the event. Should an incident occur, the liaison is to report this as soon as possible. It must be clear to the attendees how the liaison can be contacted immediately during the event, for example by publishing a phone number on the website, on the event program, and/or by announcing it during the start of the event.
4. For events with over 150 attendees, there must be at least three liaisons available. 

#### 1.4 Individual Representation

When individuals represent the MODX project in other channels, they are also expected to follow the MODX Code of Conduct. This includes for example when speaking about MODX at a meetup or usergroup not focused on MODX, or on online channels that the MODX Project Leadership, MODX Advisory Board or MODX Ambassadors hold no direct control over. 

### 2. Incident Response

To report a breach of the Code of Conduct a special email address is available. Contacting this email address will notify the MODX Project Leadership, the MODX Advisory Board Chair, the MODX Advisory Board Vice-Chair and one or more appointed and publicly listed members of the MODX Advisory Board or outside experts. 

Incidents are always treated confidentially. Any sort of information sharing outside the recipients of the special email address must be on a need-to-know basis. When information about an incident is shared with other parties, including the remainder of the MODX Team or MODX Advisory Board, it must be stripped of names of all parties involved in the incident, and other details that might identify the individuals involved. 

If an incident happened in publicly, the responders may decide to publish a public statement on the incident that it is being investigated. 

#### 2.1 Response Process

The following steps and guidelines should be adhered to by the responders when an incident is reported.

1. Confirm to the responder that the incident has been received and will be investigated. 
2. Collect evidence related to the incident into an incident report available to the responders. This may include chat logs, social media posts or messages and statements from involved parties or witnesses.  
3. Evaluate the evidence and discuss the evidence with the involved parties. Ideally the incident can be sufficiently resolved so that no further action is required. The incident report is securely archived.
4. If no suitable resolution can be achieved through discussion, the responders may decide to continue further research and to decide to sanction a party which acted against the code of conduct. 

#### 2.2 Enforcement

If the responders find an individual to have acted against the code of conduct, they may issue sanctions to individuals. This enforcement must be weighed against the type of offense, the wishes of the victim/recipient, the chance or history of repeating offenses and how the parties have responded to the investigation.

Possible repercussions may include:

- Temporary or permanent ban from any or all online channels per section 1.2.
- Temporary or permanent ban from any or all offline channels per section 1.3.
- If the individual carries an assigned role of authority, such as that of member of the MODX Advisory Board, MODX Ambassador or Core Integrator, they may temporarily or permanently lose that role.
