# Decorated Distributions

_Note: This recommendation is a DRAFT for consideration of the MODX Advisory&nbsp;Board._

The MODX Advisory Board recommends supporting Snapshots, Teleport Packages, and Extras that auto&ndash;install during the MODX setup process of decorated distributions. This will allow endless possibilities of first&nbsp;impressions after unboxing any given decorated&ndash;distribution.

## Goal of Recommendation

To further solidify the perception of “MODX” as creative freedom by integrating enhancements seamlessly with the MODX&nbsp;Setup&nbsp;experience.

## Recommendation

Historically “MODX” has been considered by many to be simply the “MODX core” files distributed from places like modx.com. As Revolution has evolved, the MODX ecosystem has been empowered with the ability to create, share, export, import various types of MODX Snapshots and Teleport Packages. Now more than ever, “MODX” is whatever you make&nbsp;of&nbsp;it.

The MODX Advisory Board may, through its various distribution channels, market and refer to “MODX” as not just the core files but as the ability and limitless results of managing content using a lightweight and enhanceable core which embraces creative freedom throughout. Marketing copy such as “MODX 3.0 with an all&ndash;new Media Manager” may give end users the impression that "MODX has an all new Media Manager". And that's fine. Because it does, regardless of if a media manager is shipped within the core&nbsp;distribution.
