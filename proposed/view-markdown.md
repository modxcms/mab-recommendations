## Goal of Recommendation

To make reviewing MAB DRAFTS more user&nbsp;friendly.

## Relevant Recommendations
[Accessible Setup](https://github.com/modxcms/mab-recommendations/pull/14)

## Recommendation
MAB DRAFTS are submitted as pull requests, but many of them do not have links to read the rendered markdown file. Git commits and file diffs aren't a very legible way to read markdown. This DRAFT recommends that a link to view the rendered markdown be placed in the body of the pull&nbsp;request.
