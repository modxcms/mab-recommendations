# MODX Advisory Board Recommendations

This repository contains accepted recommendations from the [MODX Advisory Board](https://modx.com/community/modx-advisory-board/mab-charter). 

## Procedure

This procedure shows on a high level how recommendations go from draft to being accepted on this GitHub repository. For specific processes, please read the [Recommendations Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aRId889oHBxnUB4kYpToNJsA9_IJfXqvuw0hw32MIU/edit#heading=h.g0aprq6l7z9k) and the [Voting Protocol](https://modx.com/community/modx-advisory-board/mab-voting-protocol). 

1. A member of the board drafts a Recommendation. Once ready for review, they submit a pull request to this repository with the contents and a `draft` label. The pull request will allow in-context review and discussion.
2. Once the recommendation has been reviewed, typically after a MAB meeting, the (Vice-)Chair calls for a vote on the recommendation according to the [Voting Protocol](https://modx.com/community/modx-advisory-board/mab-voting-protocol). These votes will be cast by the MAB members by commenting on the pull request with a :+1: or :-1:
3. When the vote ends (after 14 days or when all MAB members voted), the (Vice-)Chair ends the vote and either accepts the pull request, merging the recommendation into the repository, or closes the pull request.
